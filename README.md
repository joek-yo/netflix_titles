Difficulties Encountered
Uploading the "netflix_titles" dataset to SQL was challenging due to ensuring the table schema matched the dataset structure. Managing potential issues like character encoding and handling large dataset uploads without timing out were also significant challenges.

Interesting Observation
One interesting aspect of the process was how different SQL tools and platforms handle large datasets. I found that some platforms provided more intuitive interfaces and better error handling during the upload process, making it smoother and more efficient. This observation highlighted the importance of choosing the right tools for database management tasks.
